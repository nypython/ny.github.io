    <p>a notorious banking trojan was just taken down by international law enforcement in a coordinated move to disrupt the cybercrime campaign.
        11 different countries joined forces to takedown the mobile malware called Flubot, 
        which was first discovered in Decemeber of 2020 and uses SMS phishing attacks to steal passwords, sensitive information and banking
        credentials from android(and now IOS) phones. Authorities from australia, belgium, finland, hungary, ireland, romania, spain, sweden,
        switzerland, the netherlands, and the US investigated the Flubot operation.
        
        Flubot was spread via SMS, and evaded user red flags by pretending to be an innocuous shipping carrier tracking app like Fedex or DHL.
        The SMS would request a malware ridden app to be download on the users phone, which would request access to the android accessibility
        Service allowing it to steal data. it would use the android phones contacts to further spread.
        
        after hydra, flubot was the second largest banking trojan due to its speed of infecting devices.
        it appears that the main initiative by law enforcement was to stop it's infection rate, as no arrests have been made at this time though europol has
        stated they're actively seeking individuals involved in the flubot operation.

                while devices are no longer calling home to an attacker-controlled
                server, if you're worried about malware on your phone, the best thing you can do is factory reset the device.
